\section{M\&A Modeling}
	\subsection*{Accretion/Dilution Analysis}
	\underline{Accretive:} acquisition increases acquirer's EPS\\
	\underline{Dilutive:} acquisition decreases acquirer's EPS\\
	Exchange ratio: Target Stock Price/Acquirer Stock Price\\
	New shares outstanding = Acquirer's shares outstanding + (Exchange Ratio) $\times$ Target's shares outstanding\\
	Amount Paid = Target's Pre-Bid Market Cap + Acquisition Premium\\
	Value Acquired = Target's Value + PV(Synergies)\\
	Value created when: PV(Synergies) > Acquisition premium\\
	$\frac{x}{N_{T}} < \frac{P_{T}}{P_{A}}\left(1 + \frac{S}{T}\right)$
	
	\subsection*{Treasury Stock Method}
	Count firm's fully diluted share count by including net new shares created by unexercised ITM warrants and options as well as other dilutive securities.
	
	\subsection*{Stock-based Compensation}
	RSU's: give employees stored stock\\
	ESO's: create new shares for employees who exercise.
